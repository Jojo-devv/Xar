2. Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 11 or higher.
3. MySQL Database Server: Version 8.0 or higher.
4. RAM: At least 4GB (8GB recommended).
5. Storage: At least 500MB of free disk space.
6. Software: 
   - Apache NetBeans IDE 12.0 or higher (for running/editing the source code).
   - MySQL Workbench (for database management).
   - A suitable text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Notepad++) for configuration files.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Set Up MySQL Database
- Open MySQL Workbench and create a new database named `inventory_management`.
- Import the provided SQL dump file (`inventory_management.sql`) into the database. This file contains all the necessary tables and sample data.
  - Go to *File > Open SQL Script, select the SQL file, and execute it.
- Verify that the tables (`products`, `customers`, `suppliers`, `users`, etc.) are correctly created and populated.

### 2. Configure Database Connection
- Navigate to the `src/database` directory in the project files.
- Open the `ConnectionFactory.java` file using a text editor or IDE.
- Update the following credentials in the file to match your local MySQL setup:
  ```java
  private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/inventory_management";
  private static final String USER = "root"; // Replace with your MySQL username
  private static final String PASSWORD = "root"; // Replace with your MySQL password
  ```
- Save the changes.

### 3. Run the Application
- Open Apache NetBeans (or any Java IDE you prefer).
- Load the project by selecting *File > Open Project* and navigating to the root folder of the SCIMS project.
- Clean and build the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved. In NetBeans, this can be done via *Run > Clean and Build Project*.
- Execute the main application by running the `Main.java` file located in the `src/ui` directory.

### 4. Logging In
- Default administrator credentials for initial login:
  - Username: admin
  - Password: admin
- Upon successful login, you will be directed to the dashboard.

### 5. Application Usage
- Dashboard: Provides a summary of key metrics, such as stock levels and recent transactions.
- Products: Add, update, delete, and view products in the inventory.
- Customers: Manage customer information.
- Suppliers: Record and modify supplier details.
- Sales and Purchases: Perform sales and purchase transactions, with automatic stock updates.
- Users: Administrators can add and manage employee accounts.
- Reports: Generate detailed reports of stock levels, transactions, and user activity logs.

### 6. Packaging and Distribution (Optional)
- If you need to run the application outside the IDE:
  - Navigate to the `dist` directory and locate the `SCIMS.jar` file.
  - Ensure all dependencies in the `lib` folder are available in the same directory as the `.jar` file.
  - Run the `.jar` file using the command:
    ```sh
    java -jar SCIMS.jar
    ```

## Troubleshooting
### 1. Database Connection Issues
- Ensure the MySQL server is running and the credentials in `ConnectionFactory.java` are correct.
- Confirm that the `inventory_management` database exists and contains all required tables.

### 2. Application Crashes
- Verify that all dependencies are correctly included in the `lib` folder.
- Check the application log for error details (found in the `logs` directory).

### 3. Login Failures
- Reset the administrator credentials directly in the `users` table of the database using MySQL Workbench.
